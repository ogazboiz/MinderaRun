## Tips

- Keep files small (< 100KB each)
- Use MP3 format for best browser compatibility
- Volume is controlled in-game, so normalize sounds to similar levels
- Sounds are optional - game works without them

## Current Status

The game will work perfectly fine without sound files. The sound system is designed to fail gracefully if files are missing.
