## 📝 Summary

This PR improves project documentation by adding comprehensive system architecture diagrams and cleaning up redundant files to prepare for hackathon submission.

## ✨ Changes

### 🏗️ Documentation Improvements
- **Added complete system architecture diagrams** showing the full data flow:
  - Frontend → WalletConnect → Smart Contracts → HTS Tokens → Mirror Node
  - Player interaction flows (wallet connection, registration, gameplay, claiming rewards)
  - Component interaction flow (Zustand → ContractManager → wagmi → Hedera)
  - Smart Contract → Token → NFT minting flow
- **Enhanced README.md** with detailed architecture sections following hackathon requirements
- **Added root `.gitignore`** to ensure sensitive files are excluded

### 🧹 Repository Cleanup
- **Removed redundant markdown files**:
  - `HEDERA_GAME_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Merged into main README
  - `HEDERA_HACKATHON_SUBMISSION.md` - Consolidated into README
  - `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Moved to scripts/README.md
  - `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Outdated checklist removed
  - `NFT_METADATA_GUIDE.md` - Consolidated into scripts/README.md
  - `frontend/public/sounds/README.md` - Unnecessary file removed

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed `questionsCorrect` calculation** in `gameStore.ts` - Now correctly counts quiz answers instead of filtering for value 0
- Added fallback logic to ensure `questionsCorrect >= 1` when stage is completed

## 🎯 Hackathon Compliance

This PR ensures the repository meets hackathon submission requirements:
- ✅ **Fresh Repository** - Cleaned up unnecessary files
- ✅ **Well-Structured README** - Comprehensive documentation with idea, stack, and setup steps
- ✅ **Good Coding Practices** - Clean, modular code structure
- ✅ **Public Repository** - Ready for submission

## 📊 Architecture Overview

The new diagrams illustrate:
1. **System Architecture** - Complete component relationships from frontend to Hedera network
2. **Data Flow** - Step-by-step player interaction flows
3. **Token/NFT Flow** - How smart contracts trigger token and NFT minting via Hedera SDK
4. **Mirror Node Integration** - How marketplace queries NFT data from Mirror Node API

## 🔍 Files Changed

### Added
- `.gitignore` - Root-level gitignore for sensitive files

### Modified
